## About this Project

This project's purpose is to create a visually captivating and interactive fractal explorer using Rust and the Bevy engine. It focuses on rendering Julia fractals, offering real-time interactions and visualizations.

The original version was implemented with wasm, but I have since moved to bevy, due to the tools available for expanding features and functionality.

This project is based off the super simple and fun [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4vN2Z0JuZI&ab_channel=timClicks) that [Tim McNamara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timmcnamaranz/) did. 

### Goals

The primary goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of Rust and Bevy in creating high-performance, real-time graphical applications. We aim to:

- Create a dynamic fractal rendering engine using Rust.
- Utilize Bevy for real-time fractal visualization and interactions.
- Provide an educational and engaging experience for users to explore and learn about fractals.

## Roadmap:

### Rendering Engine

- [ ] **Fractal Generation using Rust**
    - [x] Implement Julia fractal generation.
    - [ ] Optimize fractal generation for performance.
    - [ ] Implement 'infinite zoom' functionality.
        - [x] Implement 'Zoom' functionality
        - [ ] Implement return to 1.0x zoom functionality
    - [ ] **Add support for different fractal types:**
        - [ ] Add the Mandelbrot Set
        - [ ] Add the Koch Snowflake
        - [ ] Add the Barnsley fern
        - [ ] Add the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle
    - [ ] Allow for multiple sets that can be rendered

- [ ] **Integration with Bevy Engine**
    - [x] Setup Bevy to handle real-time rendering.
    - [ ] Create interactive UI elements 
        - [ ] For fractal manipulation.
        - [ ] For selecting fractal parameters
        - [ ] For selecting fractal set
    - [ ] Update to Bevy 0.13.0

- [ ] **Optimization and Enhancement**
    - [x] Add color to rendering
    - [ ] Model render color scheme selection
    - [ ] Implement shader-based rendering for complex visual effects.
    - [ ] Benchmarking Application for Bottlenecks
    - [ ] Refactor Codebase for extensisibility 

### Additional Features

- [ ] **User Interaction**
    - [x] Implement click to navigate.
    - [ ] Click and Drag to move view
    - [ ] Allow users to modify fractal parameters in real-time.
    - [ ] Color pallette selection for fractal set colors

- [ ] **Educational Content**
    - [ ] Provide informational content on fractals and their mathematical significance.

### Documentation & Community

- [ ] **Documentation**
    - [ ] Create thorough documentation for setup and usage.
    - [ ] Document the mathematical concepts behind fractals.
    - [ ] Better commenting for Documentation
    - [ ] Project Documentation

- [ ] **Community Engagement**
    - [ ] Establish a platform for community feedback and contributions.
    - [ ] UI Splash Screen

- [x] **Web Assembly**
    - [x] Setup application to compile to wasm and run in browser

- [ ] **Testing**
    - [ ] Implement Testing
        - [ ] Unit Testing for code integrity
        - [ ] Community testing for feedback and improvements
